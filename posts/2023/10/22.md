Your life is like a car ride, there will always be too many moving pieces and its easy to lose track of passengers in the car.

I convinced myself that we were friends, & enjoyed the convenient misinterpretation that they liked me, too.

I was wrong.
I was just a passenger in their car.
They were just a passenger in mine.
We were never friends.
We were just two people who happened to be going in the same direction for a while.
