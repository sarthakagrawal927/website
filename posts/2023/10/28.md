Life would be so much better if we could control our urges of the present to do the things our future self would thank us for.

That is why I feel having ambitious goals is important. No matter what goals you have in life if you can make little progress towards them today, your future self will thank you for it.

Its okay to have lazy days, you just need to ensure some progress is made towards your goals.

Its okay to have small goals or over ambitious goals, you just need to ensure some progress is made towards your goals.

But if you don't have any goals, you are probably just passing away precious time. Its always better to have some goals, ambitions, desires, interests, hobbies, etc. in life. And you should strive to make progress towards them and have fun while doing so.

Regrets are inevitable, you can minimize them or you can maximize them.
You can choose the things you regret or you can let them be.
You can change the trajectory of your life, or you can let it be.

Its your choice, in the present. So future can thank you for it.
