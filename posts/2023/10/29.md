I really like the line,

> I worked too hard for too long and sacrificed too much to admit that I was just lucky

People like to think they control what happens to them, but they don't. That luck doesn't matter.

I like to think of luck as a multiplier. Life is all about probabilities of things & luck is a multiplier to it. Everything has a probability based on your decisions till now.

Results are the product of the probabilities you create for yourself by working hard and the your luck at that time. Its like your life's outcome is decided based on roll of 2 dices & you have one in your control. There are no ways to measure the potence of each individual dice.

What you can do is increase the number of rolls and improve the power of the die in your control. Basic probability suggests that the more you roll, the higher the chances for you to succeed provided there are no extreme result due to bad roll.
