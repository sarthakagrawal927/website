After reading a YC post on passion, I decided to delve deep into other posts on the topic (also ventured into regrets of people in their 20s). I summarized a few that seem reasonable and doable to me.

Fitness
- Power Lifting
- Running
- Cycling on e-bike
- Get in shape & stay there
- Visit dentist regularly
- Wear sunscreen

Computer Science
- Computing
- Algorithms (NP-Hard)
- Coding for game FF7

Learning
- Learning about my own mind and how to tame it.
- Maths (3d game programming)
- Singing Lessons
- Finance & Start investing
- Pursuit of understanding everything
- Work on making own money instead of exchanging time for money

Creating
- Building a real house, coding a game
- Building a random notes taking app
- Writing a sci-fi novel.
- Building a company to help people save time.
- Flying & Woodworking
- Gaming (WoW, lua scripts)

Others
- Watching TV Series
- Taking it easy by going home (socializing, watching series, arts, music, books)
- Doing things that would make his dad (passed) proud.
- Reading random history
- Playing Video Games
- Travel

Now when I filter this list based on what I doing now would be better than later, I get the following list:
